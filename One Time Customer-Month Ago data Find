Write a query to identify customer IDs who have ordered only once and find out how many months back the order was placed.

Use timestampdiff to find last ordered months ago

Print customer ID along with the number of months count.

Order your output in ascending order of Customer ID.



SELECT
  Orders.CustomerID AS CustomerID,
  TIMESTAMPDIFF(MONTH, MAX(Orders.OrderDate), NOW()) AS MonthsAgo
FROM
  Orders
GROUP BY
  Orders.CustomerID
HAVING
  COUNT(Orders.OrderID) = 1
ORDER BY
  CustomerID ASC;
