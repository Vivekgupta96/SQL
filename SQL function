Sure! Here are some commonly used SQL functions:

1. Aggregate Functions:
   - COUNT(): Counts the number of rows or non-null values in a column.
   - SUM(): Calculates the sum of values in a column.
   - AVG(): Calculates the average of values in a column.
   - MIN(): Returns the minimum value in a column.
   - MAX(): Returns the maximum value in a column.

2. String Functions:
   - CONCAT(): Concatenates two or more strings together.
   - LENGTH(): Returns the length of a string.
   - UPPER(): Converts a string to uppercase.
   - LOWER(): Converts a string to lowercase.
   - SUBSTRING(): Extracts a substring from a string based on a starting position and length.
   - REPLACE(): Replaces occurrences of a substring within a string.

3. Date and Time Functions:
   - NOW(): Returns the current date and time.
   - CURDATE(): Returns the current date.
   - CURTIME(): Returns the current time.
   - DATE(): Extracts the date part from a date/time value.
   - EXTRACT(): Extracts a specific part (year, month, day, hour, etc.) from a date/time value.
   - TIMESTAMPDIFF(): Calculates the difference between two date/time values in a specified unit (year, month, day, hour, etc.).
   - DATE_FORMAT(): Formats a date/time value based on a specified format.

4. Mathematical Functions:
   - ABS(): Returns the absolute value of a number.
   - ROUND(): Rounds a number to a specified number of decimal places.
   - CEILING(): Rounds a number up to the nearest integer.
   - FLOOR(): Rounds a number down to the nearest integer.
   - SQRT(): Calculates the square root of a number.
   - POWER(): Raises a number to a specified power.

5. Conditional Functions:
   - CASE WHEN: Performs conditional branching within a query.
   - COALESCE(): Returns the first non-null value in a list of expressions.
   - NULLIF(): Compares two expressions and returns null if they are equal.

These are just a few examples of SQL functions. Different database systems may have additional or specialized functions available.


Certainly! Here are some examples of SQL functions:

1. Aggregate Functions:

- COUNT():
  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Customers;
  ```

- SUM():
  ```sql
  SELECT SUM(Quantity) FROM Orders;
  ```

- AVG():
  ```sql
  SELECT AVG(Price) FROM Products;
  ```

- MIN():
  ```sql
  SELECT MIN(Age) FROM Employees;
  ```

- MAX():
  ```sql
  SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employees;
  ```

2. String Functions:

- CONCAT():
  ```sql
  SELECT CONCAT(FirstName, ' ', LastName) AS FullName FROM Customers;
  ```

- LENGTH():
  ```sql
  SELECT LENGTH(Description) FROM Products;
  ```

- UPPER():
  ```sql
  SELECT UPPER(FirstName) FROM Customers;
  ```

- LOWER():
  ```sql
  SELECT LOWER(LastName) FROM Customers;
  ```

- SUBSTRING():
  ```sql
  SELECT SUBSTRING(Title, 1, 5) FROM Books;
  ```

- REPLACE():
  ```sql
  SELECT REPLACE(Description, 'old', 'new') FROM Products;
  ```

3. Date and Time Functions:

- NOW():
  ```sql
  SELECT NOW() AS CurrentDateTime;
  ```

- CURDATE():
  ```sql
  SELECT CURDATE() AS CurrentDate;
  ```

- CURTIME():
  ```sql
  SELECT CURTIME() AS CurrentTime;
  ```

- DATE():
  ```sql
  SELECT DATE(Birthdate) FROM Employees;
  ```

- EXTRACT():
  ```sql
  SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM OrderDate) FROM Orders;
  ```

- TIMESTAMPDIFF():
  ```sql
  SELECT TIMESTAMPDIFF(MONTH, OrderDate, NOW()) FROM Orders;
  ```

- DATE_FORMAT():
  ```sql
  SELECT DATE_FORMAT(OrderDate, '%Y-%m-%d') FROM Orders;
  ```

4. Mathematical Functions:

- ABS():
  ```sql
  SELECT ABS(-10) FROM Numbers;
  ```

- ROUND():
  ```sql
  SELECT ROUND(Price, 2) FROM Products;
  ```

- CEILING():
  ```sql
  SELECT CEILING(2.4) FROM Numbers;
  ```

- FLOOR():
  ```sql
  SELECT FLOOR(3.9) FROM Numbers;
  ```

- SQRT():
  ```sql
  SELECT SQRT(25) FROM Numbers;
  ```

- POWER():
  ```sql
  SELECT POWER(2, 3) FROM Numbers;
  ```

5. Conditional Functions:

- CASE WHEN:
  ```sql
  SELECT
    OrderID,
    CASE
      WHEN Quantity > 10 THEN 'High'
      WHEN Quantity > 5 THEN 'Medium'
      ELSE 'Low'
    END AS Priority
  FROM Orders;
  ```

- COALESCE():
  ```sql
  SELECT COALESCE(FirstName, 'N/A') FROM Customers;
  ```

- NULLIF():
  ```sql
  SELECT NULLIF(Quantity, 0) FROM Products;
  ```

These examples illustrate how the SQL functions can be used in various scenarios. Please note that the specific syntax and usage of functions may vary depending on the database system you are using.
